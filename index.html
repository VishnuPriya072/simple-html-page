<p>A car is a means of transport used for traveling from one place to another. This is a 
    four-wheeler used by individuals or family members. We all use cars in our daily 
    lives to go from one place to another for work. A car is a beautiful vehicle that has comfortable 
    seats, AC, and windows. It is basically used to reduce travel distance and time. 
    Due to increased automobile industries, we see different types of cars ranging from 
    simple to the most luxurious ones. Every individual wishes to buy or purchase a car which makes 
    their journey a comfortable and enjoyable experience.
